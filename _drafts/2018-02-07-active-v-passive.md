Want to eat right?  Get more exercise?  Handle your money better?  Technology might help, but it can't actually put the food in your mouth, move your body or choose what you spend your money on.  Technology can only go so far.

They'll set up your budget, automatically withdraw funds to a savings account periodically, categorize all your expenses and then warn you when you're spending too much.

You can do so much better when you take control.

## Active is better
