You Need a Budget 4 (YNAB4) is a good application.  Too bad they took to the cloud :(  Luckily you can now easily import YNAB4 budget files into Buckets!

<div style="text-align: center; padding: 1rem;"><img width="300" style="border-radius: 3px;" src="{{ site.url }}/img/ynab/import-shot.png"></div>

First make a new budget file, then select the menu option "Budget" > "Import From YNAB".  Choose your `.ynab4` file and continue to enjoy private budgeting!
