Do you get tired of downloading transaction files from your bank?  Or are you tired of paying a monthly fee for a company to do it for you?  After months of work, I'm pleased to announce a very exciting new feature: Macros.

<!--more-->

Starting today, with [Buckets v0.22.0](https://github.com/buckets/application/releases/latest), you can automate the downloading of OFX/QFX files from your bank.  Record yourself doing it once, then replay with the click of a button.

This really changes everything, especially if you have multiple bank accounts.  What other budgeting applications charge a monthly fee for, you can now do for free.  And it's completely private!  Macros are encrypted and stored within the budget file on your computer and nowhere else.

You're welcome!

## Experimental 

At this point, macros are experimental&mdash;they'll usually work, but might break between versions.  Some banks are known not to work...yet.  Let me know if your bank works/doesn't.  Also, if your bank doesn't offer OFX/QFX/Quicken files, please tell me what files they do offer so Buckets can work for you.  Next up are CSV files.

Happy budgeting!

&mdash; Matt
