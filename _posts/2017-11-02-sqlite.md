If you want programmatic access to your budget, here's a secret: Buckets files are just SQLite databases.

<!--more-->

```text
$ sqlite3 Tutorial.buckets 
SQLite version 3.16.0 2016-11-04 19:09:39
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite> select count(*) from account;
3
```

You're welcome to open up your budget files and even modify them.  Just be sure to follow [all the normal SQLite concurrency tips.](https://sqlite.org/faq.html#q5)  The Buckets app includes the most current documentation about the file format (look in the Help menu).

## Example - How much is in the bank?

On macOS or Linux, the `sqlite3` command line tool is likely already installed.  Here's a one line program that will tell you how much money you have in the bank.  Remember that all amounts are stored as integers (hence the `printf` call):

```bash
$ echo 'SELECT printf("%.2f", sum(balance)/100.0) AS balance FROM account;' \
| sqlite3 Tutorial.buckets
4852.24
```


And if you find the transaction-importing functions of Buckets limited, you're welcome to write your own using your favorite language's SQLite library.

Happy Budgeting!
