Just wanted to post a quick status update.  Prepare to be underwhelmed :)  I mean, *I'm* excited for the next release, but most of the work lately has been under-the-hood stuff&mdash;all to get ready for the Buckets companion mobile app! ðŸ“± ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ“± ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ“±

In other words, if everything works right, the next version of Buckets should work exactly like the current version. Zero new features.  And hopefully zero new bugs, too.

Once that's out, debt-handling is next, then net wealth stuff, etc...  All in parallel with the mobile apps.  Follow along in real-time at [GitHub](https://github.com/buckets/application/projects/2?fullscreen=true).
