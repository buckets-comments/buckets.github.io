Happy New Year!

![Blank book]({{ site.url }}/img/happynewyear2018/blankbook.jpg)

New years are like blank books, for which you are the author.  With just an old-fashioned fountain pen.  Hey, your book's binding is cracked.  Maybe go get some tape or glue before you start writing?  Also, you are hungry.  Better eat lunch first.

Good luck this year...

(at least you can count on your budget going well)
