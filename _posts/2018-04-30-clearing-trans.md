The [newest version of Buckets](https://www.budgetwithbuckets.com) includes transaction clearing!  If you manually enter transactions, this will help reconcile what you keep in Buckets with what your bank has.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

Here's a basic process you might use:

1. Buy a cookie
2. Enter a transaction for the cookie in Buckets
3. Once you see that cookie purchase on your bank statement, click the green check mark (hover over the transaction) to mark it as cleared.
