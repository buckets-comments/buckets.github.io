If you choose to follow only one principle discussed on this blog, this is it:

> Spend less than you earn.

You will end up financially happier if you do.

Do you spend less than you earn?  If not, let me convince you that you can:


## The Secret ##

You might be thinking of all kinds of reasons why you can't possibly spend less than you earn.  Before we tackle those reasons, let me share the secret to achieving this:  **start small!**  How small?  Really small. <span style="font-size: 50%;">Really, really small.</span>  <span style="font-size: 10%">Yeah, this small.</span>

*Stop reading and sit quietly for ten seconds.*  Did you spend any money during the last 10 seconds?  No?  Congratulations!  You spent less than you earned for the last 10 seconds.

I'm serious... :sparkles: Celebrate! :clap: You did it for 10 seconds!


## Longer ##

Now work up to a *single day*.  How much did you earn today?  Did you spend less than that today?  If so, pause to congratulate yourself.  If not, can you do it tomorrow?

But I hear you saying, "Some days I have to pay rent or a mortgage -- and I'll always fail on those days."  That's true.  So celebrate the seconds when you succeed.  Celebrate the days when you succeed.  Then move on to celebrate spending less than you earn for *an entire week*.

And then...


## A Game ##

It becomes a game.  Here's a true story:

My wife and I consistently spent more on groceries than we budgeted every month.  We would sometimes increase the food budget (at the expense of other things), but we had a feeling that we were spending more on groceries than we needed to.  Last October, we decided to try *really* hard to spend $100 less on groceries than we had the previous several months.  It was an outrageous goal.  We didn't realistically think we would achieve it, or that we would have to eat stale bread and water in order to make it.  But we made it into a game.  A month-long game.  A fun game.

And we surprised ourselves by actually achieving it.  We didn't suffer at all.  I chose more sale items, shopped on a full stomach, and forewent some luxuries.  Mostly, we just *tried*.  Succeeding that month felt so good.


## Yearly ##

The time period that really counts is the year.  Even if there are months when you spend more than you earn, if you can consistently spend less than you earn every year, you are on your way to financial happiness.  *You really can do it* if you start small and work your way up.

Make a sheet like this that you can hang up on a wall (if things-hanging-on-walls is the kind of thing that motivates you&mdash;or just keep track on a paper somewhere).

<table class="form full-width">
<tr>
    <td>Period</td>
    <td>How much I earned</td>
    <td>How much I spent</td>
    <td>
        How much I saved
        <br/>(earned - spent)
    </td>
</tr>

## Barriers to success ##

Now let's tackle some of the barriers to success:

### 1. But I don't earn enough ###

You might think you can't possibly follow this principle because you don't make enough money.  You might have friends or family that earn more money than you and imagine that "if I just earned what they did, then I would be able to spend less."

Consider the opposite comparison:

- How many people are there in the world that make less money than you do?
- How many people make *significantly* less than you?

Earning more money might improve your chances of success, but it is only *one* of many tactics.


### 2. I've got a ton of debt ###

Debt is a problem.  Debt can be downright evil and crippling.  When debt with interest is left to compound, your chances of success rapidly go down.  Before you can spend less than you earn, you'll need to first get out of debt.  We'll have some other articles with ideas for freeing yourself from debt.
